# COVIDCalc  
A calculator plus csv reader writer I made to record and track the COVID-19 outbreak for Missouri, Joplin,MO, and the World.  

JHD(Joplin Health Department) has changed their dashboard(again) and will now update Mon. thru Fri.  
MoDHSS has once again changed their dashboard causing a lot of confusion to obtain data.  

# NOTE: MoDHSS data for Joplin, MO. doesn't match the JHD released data.
